When you move to the states, you most likely won't be able to use your Canadian bank account or credit card without incurring expensive fees. So, you're going to need to open accounts with U.S. institutions. In this guide, I will be going over the best options, given my experience.

1.

# Bank Account

The first thing you want to do is to set up a checking account. There are many banks you can choose from. The top two that I recommend are Chase and Bank of America. The following is a simple comparison of the two:

1. Account Fees
   
   The fees for checking accounts for both are similar. Both banks offer ways to waive the monthly fee (e.g. having a minimum balance of $1500).

2. Number of Branches/ATMs
   
   Both banks are easily accessible in most states, however BoA has a better presence across all states compared to Chase. If you plan on travelling a lot in the states then this might be important for you. 

3. Online/Mobile banking
   
   Both give you access to your accounts through online and mobile banking. I have used both bank's mobile apps and I personally prefer Chase.

4. Signup Bonuses
   
   Chase usually offers better signup bonuses compared to BoA. Make sure to compare both bank's offers when you want to open an account. If any of your friends already have an account with the bank, you might be able to get a referral bonus too.

Other options worth mentioning:

1. **[TD Bank](https://www.td.com/us/)**
   
   TD Bank is the U.S. branch of TD Canada Trust. TD Bank offers all the regular banking services plus cross-border banking which is useful if you plan to transfer money to/from Canada frequently (more later). Their Convenience Checking account offering has no fees   with a minimum balance of $100. **TD bank only has branches in the east coast (mostly in NYC).**

2. **[RBC Bank](https://www.rbcbank.com)**
   
   This is the U.S. branch of RBC, specifically targeted towards Canadian expats and snowbirds. There are no physical branches in the USA but you can access their network of [no-fee ATMS](https://maps.rbc.com/rbcbank/index.php). Their most basic checking account costs $4 per month. This option is only worthwhile if you also have a relationship with RBC in Canada.

# Credit Card

As a Canadian you will not have any credit history in the U.S. Therefore, you will have limited options for getting a credit card. However, some institutions might be able to use your Canadian credit history when you apply for a credit card. Note that a U.S. dollar credit card from a Canadian bank does not build a U.S. credit history.

Companies that can use your Canadian credit history:

1. American Express **(recommended)**  
   
   When applying for a credit card with AMEX, choose the option stating that you do not have credit history in the U.S. (see picture). If you already have a credit card with AMEX, you can also use the [Global Card Transfer](https://www.americanexpress.com/global-card-transfers/index.shtml) service to apply for a U.S. credit card.

2. [TD Bank](https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/solutions/cross-border-banking/accounts/?tdtab=2)
   
   To apply for a credit card with TD Bank you need to have a U.S. address and already have an account with them. You can open an account (TD Convenience Checking) online. To apply for the credit card you need to fill out [this application](https://www.tdbank.com/exc/pdf/Foreign-National-Application.pdf). Call the Cross-Border Banking support line (1-877-700-2913) for further info.

3. [RBC Bank](https://www.rbcbank.com/cross-border/us-credit-cards.html#newcreditcard)
   
   In order to apply for a credit card, you also have to open an account with them ($4 per month).

For your first credit card, it is best to use a company that can use your Canadian credit history so you minimize your chance of rejection and get approved for a higher credit limit. However, you could also try the following companies even with no U.S. credit history. I recommend waiting 4-6 weeks from the time you get your SSN to apply for a credit card.

1. Discover

   Discover is a good choice for your first credit card. You can apply for their student credit cards or a secured credit card if you just want to start building credit history. The downside with Discover is that it is less widely accepted by merchants compared to a Visa, MasterCard, or AMEX card.

2. BoA
   
   The Cash Rewards, Travel Rewards, or one of the student cards are a good option.
   
3. Chase
   
   Chase might have the lowest acceptance rate among all the other mentioned companies. It is best to open a banking account with them first and set up a direct deposit before applying for a credit card. The Chase Freedom Unlimited and Freedom Flex are both great intro credit cards.


# Cross-border Money Transfer

If you are in the U.S temporarily, you probably want to move some of the money back with you to Canada. Here are a few of the best ways to do that:

1. Cash
   
   The simplest option is to physically carry cash with you back to Canada. Then you can exchange it to CAD at an exchange office or deposit it into a US dollar account and exchange it when needed. Remember that you can only bring currency worth up to $10000 CAD without having to declare it at the border customs.
   
   
2. Online Exchange Services
    - [Wise](//wise.com) (formerly TransferWise)
    - [Xoom](//xoom.com/canada)
    - [XE](//xe.com)
  
   Usually, Wise has the best rates but it's worth comparing all the options at the time of exchange.

3. Cross-border Banking (TD / RBC)
   
    One of the benefits of opening a bank account with TD or RBC in the U.S. is their cross-border services. With TD, you can transfer up to $5000 USD daily from your TD Bank account to your TD Canada Trust U.S. dollar account. However with RBC, it seems you can't transfer U.S. dollars without exchanging to CAD first therefore the exchange rate might not be ideal.

If you still don't know which companies to use for each of your financial needs here is my preference:

- Day-to-day Banking: **Chase Total Checking**
- Credit Card: **AMEX**
- Cross-border Transfers
  - CAD to USD (and vice versa): **Wise (TransferWise)**
  - USD to USD: **TD Bank / TD Canada Trust**
